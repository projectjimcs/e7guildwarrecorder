# Roadmap to be completed before release:

* Show top 10 highest winrate defense in the last 30 days
* Matches result column difficult to read with those colors. Change styling, maybe add more obvious icons.
* Hide edit action until later date
* Styling overall for readability across the app
* Add pagination for matches page as it will get large pretty quickly
