# Description

Guild war recorder for the mobile game Epic Seven. Used to record matches from previous wars to give insight on combinations of heroes that may work well for future wars.

# Roadmap to be completed before release

* Matches result column difficult to read with those colors. Change styling, maybe add more obvious icons.
* Hide edit action until later date
* Styling overall for readability across the app
* Change redirect page after adding a new match for faster creates
* Highest win rate comps need to be checked for amount played, since matches with 1 win will always be 100%
* Need better clarification for match creation/modification (ie. Won against defense or won against offense?)
